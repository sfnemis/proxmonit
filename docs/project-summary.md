# ProxMonX Project Summary

## Project Overview

ProxMonX is a comprehensive monitoring tool for Proxmox environments, providing real-time metrics, historical data visualization, multi-cluster support, user management, and notifications through various channels.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Metrics**: Monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network usage for VMs, LXCs, and hosts
- **Historical Data**: Store and visualize 90 days of performance data
- **Multi-cluster Support**: Monitor multiple Proxmox clusters from a single dashboard
- **User Management**: Role-based access control with two-factor authentication
- **Notifications**: Receive alerts via Gotify, Email, Discord, and Telegram
- **Responsive Design**: Access from desktop or mobile devices

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend

- **Framework**: Svelte
- **UI Library**: TailwindCSS
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **Build Tool**: Vite

The frontend is a responsive single-page application (SPA) that communicates with the backend API to retrieve and display data. It features a modern, clean UI with real-time updates and interactive charts.

### Backend

- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Authentication**: JWT with 2FA support
- **API Integration**: Proxmox API
- **Scheduling**: node-cron for metrics collection
- **Notifications**: Email, Discord, Telegram, and Gotify

The backend provides a RESTful API for the frontend, handles authentication and authorization, collects and stores metrics, and sends notifications based on configured alert rules.

## Development Process

The project was developed in three phases:

1. **Frontend Development**: Setting up the Svelte application, creating the UI components, and implementing the user interface.
2. **Backend Development**: Setting up the Node.js application, implementing the API, database models, and business logic.
3. **Integration and Deployment**: Connecting the frontend and backend, creating documentation, and developing deployment scripts.

## Deployment Options

ProxMonX can be deployed in several ways:

1. **Debian 12 LXC Container**: The recommended deployment method, using the provided `lxc-deploy.sh` script.
2. **Docker Containers**: Using Docker and Docker Compose for containerized deployment.
3. **Manual Installation**: Step-by-step installation on a Debian or Ubuntu server.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for ProxMonX include:

1. **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning for anomaly detection and predictive analytics.
2. **Additional Notification Channels**: Support for more notification channels like Slack, Microsoft Teams, etc.
3. **Custom Dashboards**: Allow users to create custom dashboards with their preferred metrics.
4. **API Documentation**: Interactive API documentation using Swagger or similar tools.
5. **Mobile App**: Native mobile applications for iOS and Android.

## Conclusion

ProxMonX provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring Proxmox environments, with a focus on usability, performance, and security. The application is designed to be easy to deploy and use, while providing powerful features for monitoring and managing Proxmox clusters.
